# How to Run Code

# Problem 1:
1. Download HW1_Problem1.py to your workspace and open in an IDE.
2. Vary the initial conditions found in lines 10-12 as needed. Default is x = 0, y = 0, theta = 0.
3. Vary the time period found in line 19 as needed. Default is 10s.
4. Hit "Run"
5. Observe the plot produced by the state space model.
6. PROGRAM END

# Problem 2:
1. Download HW1_Problem2.py to your workspace and open in an IDE.
2. Hit "Run"
3. Observe the Forward Velocity Kinematics printed in the terminal.
4. There is a note regarding the inverse kinematics calculations. In short: see report for inverse kinematics description.
5. PROGRAM END
